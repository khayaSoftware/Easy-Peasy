User Requirements Document

All information on user requirements was found from IT Tallaght moodle PowerPoint design life cycle.
For our website, which is a recipe website, the users will range from various different ages starting with 16 all the way up to elderly people 80+. This webpage should take this into consideration and have easy navigation and reading to cater for elderly users and people less familiar with the internet. In doing this it opens the webpage to a large audience. 
The colour scheme for the web site shouldn’t stand out too much. The background should have a mellow colour that sets a relaxed atmosphere and then key points should be highlighted by using different shades of blue or colours. 
Our homepage should have something to make it more interesting and a meal of the day could be effective. This would allow users to come back to the website on a regular basis as they know it will be updated and have new recipes. 
The other pages should have a variety of recipes which can easily be found using quick links and have images to show what they represent. This would mean that users could easily access the different recipes and also have a option to interact with them by commenting or adding their own recipes.
The contact us page is significant as this allows users to send in their own recipes and have them displayed on the web site. The user should also be able to find out more about the creators of the website also.
